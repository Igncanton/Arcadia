This was one of my first projects where i didn't follow any pre-established design but rather coded all along as I was imagining it,</br>
It was a fun challenge since the constant changes of how I wanted it to look as i figured it out through out the coding made me practice the same concepts over and over again.</br>
Although it's not finished I feel proud of the result.</br>
Maybe one of the most valuable lessons I got from this project is that it's better and more efficient to have a design made first or at least a visual guide to save time during the coding, that's why i learned key concepts about design and how to implement them through Figma.</br>

P.S to future Nach: I'm gonna complete this project, someday... lol <3
